            <h2>Early History</h2>
            <p>The origins of the name "Kilimanjaro" remain shrouded in mystery, with several theories but no definitive
                answer. The name is believed to be derived from the local Chagga language, yet its exact meaning is
                still debated. Some suggest it comes from the words "Kilima" (Swahili for "mountain") and "Njaro"
                (Chagga for "whiteness"), referring to its snow-capped peaks. Others believe it might mean "Mountain of
                Greatness" or "Mountain of Caravans," indicating its prominence as a landmark for trade routes.

                Local indigenous people, particularly the Chagga, have known about Kilimanjaro for centuries. Despite
                their long-standing awareness, there is no documented evidence of early ascents by these communities.
                The mountain's challenging terrain and sacred status likely deterred early climbs. It wasn't until the
                late 19th century that European explorers, including Hans Meyer and Ludwig Purtscheller, successfully
                reached its summit in 1889, marking the beginning of its recorded climbing history..</p>
