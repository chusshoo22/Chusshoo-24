            <h2>Welcome to the History of Mount Kilimanjaro</h2>
            <p>Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa, stands at an impressive 5,895 meters (19,341 feet) above
                sea level. Located in Tanzania, this iconic mountain is a natural wonder and a popular destination for
                climbers and nature enthusiasts from around the world. The mountain's unique ecosystems and cultural
                significance make it a fascinating subject of study and admiration.</p>

            <h3><a href="introduction.html">Introduction</a></h3>
            <p>Mount Kilimanjaro is not only the tallest mountain in Africa but also one of the most prominent and
                accessible peaks globally. Its geological and ecological characteristics make it a unique and intriguing
                natural feature.</p>

            <h3><a href="early-history.html">Early History</a></h3>
            <p>While local indigenous people, such as the Chagga, have known about Kilimanjaro for centuries, the
                mountain entered European consciousness in the mid-19th century through explorers and missionaries.</p>

            <h3><a href="exploration.html">Exploration</a></h3>
            <p>The 19th century saw European explorers documenting Kilimanjaro, with Johannes Rebmann being the first to
                report its existence in 1848. This era of exploration laid the groundwork for future scientific and
                climbing expeditions.</p>

            <h3><a href="modern-times.html">Modern Times</a></h3>
            <p>Today, Kilimanjaro is a major climbing destination, attracting thousands of climbers annually. It remains
                an ecological treasure and a symbol of natural beauty and human endurance.</p>
            <h3><a href="visitors.html">Visitors</a></h3>
            <p>Today, Mount Kilimanjaro has seen a steady increase in visitors over the years, reflecting its growing
                popularity as a premier trekking destination. Starting from approximately 20,000 visitors in 2000, the
                number of annual visitors has steadily climbed, reaching around 80,000 by 2024. This increase is
                attributed to several factors, including improved accessibility, better infrastructure, and the
                mountain's enduring allure as one of the Seven Summits.</p>
